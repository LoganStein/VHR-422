# Vacation Home Rents

Vacation Home Rents is a semester-long project for CS422 at UIC, which aims to create a vacation rental aggregator that pulls listings from popular websites like Airbnb and VRBO. This project is focused on UI/UX implementation and does not have any backend functionality. We were asked to find a startup and design an interface for their website/application. We chose Vacation Home Rents.
